Problem

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>No one likes homework, but your math teacher has given you an assignment to find the sum of the first N numbers.
Letâ€™s save some time by creating a program to do the calculation for you!
Take a number N as input and output the sum of all numbers from 1 to N (including N).
Sample Input
100
Sample Output
5050
Explanation: The sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 is equal to 5050.
</code></pre>

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Program
N = int(input())
sum=0
x=range(1,N+1)
#your code goes here
for i in x:
    sum=sum+i
print(sum)</code></pre>
